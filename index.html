            <h1>Kilifi beach</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Kilifi County was formed as a result of the merger of <strong>Kilifi District</strong> and <strong>Malindi District</strong>, <strong>Kilifi beach</strong> is more exclusive and has fewer tourists than the <strong>Mombasa beach</strong>, Kilifi is a beach holiday destination of the only majestic wonders that is take in the chalk sea cliffs, the beautiful sandy beaches, diverse people and cultures and as well as good climate. Tourism and fishing in Kilifi are major activities due to its proximity to the Indian Ocean, the Kilifi has some of the best beaches and the popular<strong> Kilifi</strong> <strong>beach resorts</strong> and <strong>Kilifi beach hotels,</strong> other attraction safari includes the historical sites such as the Mnarani ruins that date back to between the fourteenth and seventh century., Kilifi lies on the Kilifi Creek between Malindi and Mombasa. Bofa Beach is a wide slash of the white sand, with swaying pals and rolling Indian Ocean surf, it&rsquo;s the stuff of which fantasies are made, a path to the left of the Kilifi Bay Beach Resort takes you there. Come satisfy your need for an adrenaline rush through kitesurfing, zip lining safari, diving and many other more thrill adventures in <strong>Malindi</strong>, <strong>Watamu </strong>and Kilifi. Kilifi is the most amazing beach holidays ultimate travel destination for the quick and affordable trips for those seeking new experiences or those on the business trips. The passionate group of the Kenyans and expats have transformed Kilifi from a sweet but to the most soporific town into a stunning place renowned for its eco-projects and clean, green and joyful living safari destination. That is gorgeous beach houses stand a top the creek, yachts dance in the bay and warm waves fantasy beaches buttered with lashings of the soft white sand. On a safari you will find orange and hermit crabs, fresh oysters and pizza ovens, permaculture projects and sailings schools, beach barbecues and night swimming and as well on a safari to the Kilifi County you can spot a whale shark migration from the windy brink of the Vuma Cliffs. Kilifi is also a home to a renowned medical research center, so with a steady stream of the doctors, sailors, backpackers, aid workers, artists and yogis passing through, you will never be short of crew with whom to share those oysters. Kilifi has always been something of a secret, because of hidden location, tucked into the estuary leading to the Goshi River, it has escaped the development that has affected towns like Mombasa an<strong>d Diani</strong>, tourism first emerged in Kilifi on a small scale around 25 years ago, when the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the welcome Trust partnered and set up camp here to research the tropical diseases, with the growing influx of non-locals to the area safari &nbsp;tourism slowly started to grow, that the reason that Kilifi is well set-up for the tourists without being busy.

            <h2>How To Get to Kilifi</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">Kilifi is located along Kenya&rsquo;s coastline, overshadowed by the other Indian Ocean beach towns. Kilifi is only two hours north of<strong> Mombasa</strong>, Kenya&rsquo;s second largest city, yet receives a fraction of the visitors that the famed <strong>Diani Beach</strong> does. Kilifi, Kenya sits 1 hour north of <strong>Mombasa airport</strong> and 1.5 hours south of <strong>Malindi</strong>&rsquo; smaller airport. It makes more sense to fly to Mombasa which is closer and cheaper or to <strong>Vipingo Ridge</strong> with is only 20 minutes away. Mombasa is Kenya&rsquo;s second largest city has an international airport.&nbsp;If you are travelling from Mombasa then we suggest you take a&nbsp;taxi, the cost should be approx 70 dollars one way. Don&rsquo;t be tempted by the far cheaper tuk-tuks, you will waste hours of your life bumping in slow motion towards your destination.&nbsp;Matatu&rsquo;s also run between Mombasa and Kilifi, it&rsquo;s a crowded, hot and sticky affair but vastly cheaper. There are also a couple of bus services, check&nbsp;Kenya bus more information - Flights from&nbsp;<strong>Nairobi&nbsp;to Mombasa</strong> and vice versa run a few times a day, take an hour and are cheap. (Approx 50 USD one way). we recommend Jambojet and Kenya Airways over the smaller airlines.&nbsp;The SGR train&nbsp;runs a twice daily, very cheap, clean and comfortable service from Nairobi to Mombasa and makes a cheap, if lengthy alternative way to travel to Kilifi beach. It is entirely possible to drive to Kilifi from Nairobi, and many people do. The journey takes between 7 hours on the well paved but very busy Mombasa highway. You always have the option of stopping at <strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> en-rout</p>
              <h4>Getting to Kilifi from Mombasa and the South</h4>
              <p class="text-justify">From Mombasa, catch a matatu heading north towards Malindi. The journey should only take about two hours, depending on how frequently they make stops and how brutal the traffic going out of Mombasa is. The matatu will likely drop you off in Kilifi Town (Mavueni), or on the main highway in front of the Naivas. From there you can catch a boda (moto-taxi) or tuk-tuks to your accommodation. Taking the northbound bus from Mombasa to Lamu or Malindi is also an option, but more expensive. I&rsquo;d recommend just toughing out the matatu for two hours. It only cost me 500 shillings, whereas the bus might charge you the full price of the Mombasa to Malindi ticket.
              </p>
              <h4>Getting to Kilifi from Lamu, Malindi</h4>
              <p classs="text-justify">From Malindi, you can catch the same matatu heading southbound to Mombasa. The journey will take about an hour. If you&rsquo;re coming from Lamu, the journey is also easily doable in half a day. The matatu from<strong> Malindi</strong> or Mombasa should cost around 300 Kenyan shillings. The bus from<strong> Lamu</strong> cost me 1200 to go to Mombasa, but they didn&rsquo;t lower the price for getting off earlier. The bus company used is Tawakal. You can book a seat in advance at a Tawakal office, or show up a little early to try and guarantee yourself a seat.
              </p>
              <h4>Weather in Kilifi, Kenya</h4>
              <p class="text-justify">The <strong>weather in Kilifi beach</strong> is always warm and welcoming. The <strong>best time to visit Kilifi</strong> is during the cooler winter months of July &amp; August, when the humidity drops, the wind picks up and you might just get to snuggle in a light sweater at night. During the rest of the year Kilifi is hot, hot, hot and you want to make sure you have a beach front house or at least a pool and good A/C. The rains fall in April &ndash; June and October &ndash; November but it rarely rains the whole day.</p>
              <h3>When Is the Best Time To Visit Kilifi?</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">The high season in Kilifi coincides with the high season throughout the rest of Kenya. After the long rainy season ends, Kenya becomes significantly busier. Starting in July, you can expect to see more travelers throughout Kenya in general. The influx of people coming to see the Great Migration will eventually trickle into every corner of Kenya, Kilifi included. During New Year&rsquo;s, there is a big week-long festival that will attract people from around the world. The Beneath the Baobabs Festival is a huge event, and if you plan on visiting Kilifi around that time, I&rsquo;d recommend booking your accommodation and tickets sooner rather than later.

          <h1 class="text-center py-3 my-3"> What is there to do in Kilifi Kenya?</h1>
          <div class="col-md-12">

            <h2>Bofa Beach</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Number one on the list is <strong>Bofa beach</strong>, which rivals <strong>Diani </strong>for the whitest and softest sand in Kenya. In fact, the sand is so white that it&rsquo;s painful to open your eyes in the midday sun, and so soft you sink into it as you approach the water. Bofa Beach has a warm, translucent ocean, which recedes to reveal rock pools stuffed with starfish, shells and miniature life. When the tide returns, it brings tumbling waves and excellent kitesurfing &amp; sailing conditions. Bofa Beach has Salty&rsquo;s for refreshments but there are no sun beds, shops or toilets.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Kilifi Creek&nbsp;</h2>
            <p class="text-jjustify">Swimming across <strong>Kilifi Creek</strong> is a tradition, but you had better be a strong swimmer to attempt it. That it&rsquo;s possible to do so indicates how gentle the waters are, and this, my friend, makes it ideal for watersports. The excellent 3 Degrees South provides boats, boards and training sessions for anyone wanting to learn dinghy sailing, yachting, windsurfing, waterskiing, wake boarding and kayaking.
            </p>
            <h2>Day Trip to Watamu</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">45 minutes&rsquo; drive north of <strong>Kilifi is Watamu</strong>, another delightful seaside town with a much different vibe to Kilifi. Watamu has plenty of great attractions and restaurants that are well worth the drive, like Gede Ruins - If you leave Kilifi in the early morning, book a boat trip on Watamu Marine Park for a chance to swim with the local dolphins. The Crab Shack, a community project on Mida Creek just south of Watamu, is one of the most popular restaurants on Kenya&rsquo;s coast, serving delicious, fresh seafood. The restaurant is built on stilts, accessed via a 100m boardwalk into the mangrove forest. The Crab Shack also provides canoe tours on the creek.

            <h3>Deep-Sea Fishing</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Kilifi Boatyard</strong> (sometimes called the Yacht Club, depending on who you ask) is the launch site for some of the best big game fishing in Africa. If you&rsquo;ve never hooked a marlin, you likely will in Kilifi</p>
            <h2>Kuruwitu Conservancy&nbsp;</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Not technically Kilifi, it&rsquo;s about 20 minutes further down the coast, near to <strong>Vipingo Ridge</strong>, but&nbsp;Kuruwitu Conservancy&nbsp;is well worth a visit. The conservancy is a community led project that was set up in 2003. The 30-hectare ocean-based conservancy began by working with local fisherman to stop harmful fishing and associated practices which damaged coral and marine life. Today you can snorkel out over the conservancy and see one of the most abundant areas of marine life in all of Kenya. Look out for the little coral gardens, where the team are activity growing coral heads. You have to pay to snorkel KSH 1500, but it&rsquo;s worth it to see such a vast quantity of underwater sea life so close to the shore. Kuruwitu also hosts the superb <strong>Vipingo Beach Club</strong> where you can grab a bite to eat. Technically it&rsquo;s a members&rsquo; club for Vipingo residents.

            <h2>Mnarani Ruins</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The Mnarani Ruins are the remains of two 15th century mosques. The mosques over look Kilifi Creek from their location high on a cliff side. There are some fabulous and equally ancient baobab trees, and several tombs.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h2>Sunset Dhow Cruise</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">A dhow cruise in Kilifi doesn&rsquo;t need to be at sunset. In fact, taking a dhow out and snorkelling around is a wonderful way to spend a sultry afternoon, but heading down the creek with the sky painted orange is the perfect way to end a day.
            </p>
            <h3>Watersports</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Kilifi is becoming increasingly popular for various watersports on both the creek and the open ocean. You can try out kitesurfing, sailing, paddle boarding, snorkeling, and much more.&nbsp; Two locations in Kilifi are popular with kitesurfing enthusiasts. The water on Kilifi Creek is flat and works excellent for kitesurfers. However, the winds can be gusty, and you need to watch out for boats and canoes. Out on the ocean side, Salty&rsquo;s Kitesurf Village has a launch site with wide open spaces on the beach, with shallow warm water and very little traffic. It&rsquo;s perfect for Kitesurfers of all levels. Kilifi has some of the best dive spots in Kenya, with two purposefully sunk shipwrecks that have created stunning artificial reefs. Expect to spot giant groupers, barracudas, and parrotfish. More advanced divers can explore the underwater caverns below Vuma Cliffs. Check out&nbsp;

There&rsquo;s a community watch called Amini Kilifi and multiple security response vehicles all over town, all of whom are in direct contact with the Kenya Police Service.Some people believe Kilifi is named after Vuma Cliffs, while others think the town gets its name from &ldquo;<em>Mkilifi&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;the Swahili word for Neem trees.
